======== SDL-widgets, GUI toolkit on top of SDL  ========

Version 1.0 - febr 2013

This toolkit will not be very fit for games, instead it's aiming at normal,
possibly complicated, threaded applications. For more information, read 
doc/sdl-widgets.html. There are 3 example applications, their doc files
are acessable from doc/index.html.

To compile, run
  ./configure

This is a very minimal test whether a compiler and the SDL libraries are present
on your system. It searches for font-file FreeSans.ttf starting in directory
/usr/share/fonts. If your system stores fonts elsewere, you can use a configure
option: --fontdir. First try to run
  locate FreeSans.ttf
This might yield e.g.
  /usr/share/fonts/truetype/freefont/FreeSans.ttf
  /usr/share/vlc/skins2/fonts/FreeSans.ttf
Then run:
  ./configure --fontdir /usr/share/fonts

If succesful, run
  make

This will generate:
  SDL_widgets.o			- the widget library
  testsw			- a test program
  hello/hello			- you guess it
  make-waves/make-waves		- 4 small audio applications
  bouncy-tune/bouncy-tune	- compose and play tunes with physical-modelled instruments

There is no 'make intall', probably it's not needed because the toolkit is still simple.
By-the-way: if you want to test the toolkit with SDL-1.3, make sure that 
libraries SDL_gfx and SDL_ttf have been compiled for 1.3 too. If not, then compilation
will succeed, but a crash will occur at runtime.

If you want to try the examples, cd to their directories, then:

- make-waves doesn't need options.
- bouncy-tune running a demo tune:
    ./bouncy-tune rising.bcy
  To listen: check the 'play tune' checkbox, then click the play button.
