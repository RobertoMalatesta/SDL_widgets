# SDL_widgets

A fork of SDL_widgets by W.Boeke, for reference purposes. 

The *1.0-fixes* branch contains the code from SDL-widgets 1.0, with a few fixes along the commits. See the [1.0](https://github.com/hydren/SDL_widgets/releases/tag/1.0) tag for a intact 1.0 version. 

Please note that this version is compatible with **SDL 1.2 only**.

There is a SDL2-widgets version on the original author's website, compatible with SDL 2.0 - more info [here](http://members.chello.nl/w.boeke/SDL-widgets/).

Additionally, these *github* repositories also seem to host SDL2-widgets code:
