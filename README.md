# SDL_widgets

A fork of SDL_widgets by W.Boeke, for reference purposes. This version is compatible with **SDL 1.2 only**.

There is a SDL2-widgets version on the web, compatible with SDL 2.0 - more info [here](http://members.chello.nl/w.boeke/SDL-widgets/).

Also, these *github* also seems to host SDL2-widgets code:
